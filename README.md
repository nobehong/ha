PS4 GoldHEN Compatibility Checker 2.0
Check it out here: https://nobehong.github.io/PS4-Exploit-Checker/

This is a simple webpage that tells you if your PS4 firmware can run GoldHEN. You just open it in your PS4 browser, no extra downloads or installs.

What is this?
It looks at your PS4’s firmware version and tells you if GoldHEN works on it. If yes, it shows a button so you can launch GoldHEN right away.

How do I use it?
Open index.html on your PS4’s browser.

It will find your firmware version automatically.

If your version works, you’ll see a launch button.

If not, it’ll tell you it’s unsupported or unknown.

Which versions work?
Tested and working:

5.05, 6.72, 7.00–7.05, 7.50–7.55, 8.00–8.05, 8.50–8.55

9.00–9.05, 9.50–9.55, 11.00–11.05, 11.50–11.55

Might work (haven’t tested):

10.00, 10.01, 10.50, 12.00, 12.01, 12.50

Why bother with this?
Quick way to know if GoldHEN works on your system.

Runs fully in your PS4 browser, no hassle.

Clean and easy to use.

No confusing setup steps.

How to run it yourself
Just open index.html on your PS4 browser or put it online and open the link.

Heads up
This only checks if your firmware supports GoldHEN. It doesn’t do the jailbreak for you. Use jailbreak tools carefully and at your own risk.
