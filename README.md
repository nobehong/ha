# PS4 GoldHEN Compatibility Checker 2.0

This is a simple webpage that checks if your PS4’s firmware is compatible with the GoldHEN jailbreak. You run it right on your PS4’s browser — no extra software needed.

---

## What is this?

It tells you if your PS4 firmware version can run GoldHEN. It reads your system version from the browser and shows you whether you’re good to go. If you are, you get a button to launch GoldHEN directly.

---

## How to use it

1. Open the `index.html` on your PS4’s browser.

2. It will automatically detect your firmware version.

3. If your firmware is supported, a launch button appears.

4. If it doesn’t recognize your version or it’s unsupported, it’ll say so.
